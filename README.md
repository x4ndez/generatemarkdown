## Description
This application is the week 9 project of the edX/Monash bootcamp. The focus of this week is node.js; I used the inquirer-promise module to form the prompt to collect user input, the file system module, path module and made my own module that contains the readme template.  I found most of this project on the easy side, but then I thought I understood promises with async and await... I didn't understand it. It took me hours upon hours trying to understand it, messing with different variations.  Moods changed from "I'll just try this", then reverting commits, try again, staring at my screen, back to square one... and then I finally gave in to watching a Youtube video, and I understood it within 10 minutes.  And that is the story of how I have beautiful clean async/await and function structure in my index.js!  Thanks Youtube!
